# Virtual Library Management System

This project implements a Virtual Library Management System in Python, designed to facilitate the management of library operations. The system allows users to interact with publications, manage loans, track inventory, and receive notifications.

- **User Interaction**: Allows users to browse and borrow books, as well as manage their loans.
- **Inventory Management**: Keeps track of available publications and manages inventory.
- **Notifications**: Notifies users about loan status and due dates.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes OOP principles such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.
- **Class Hierarchy**: Includes at least six attributes and four abstract classes to ensure a flexible and efficient structure for managing library operations.
