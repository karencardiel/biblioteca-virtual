# Virtual Library Management System

This project presents the development of a **Virtual Library Management System** in Python. The system is designed to facilitate user interaction with publications, manage loans, track inventory, and send notifications. 

## Key Features:
- **User Interaction**: Enables users to browse and manage their loans on library publications.
- **Loan Management**: Keeps track of borrowed publications, loan statuses, and due dates.
- **Inventory Management**: Manages and updates the library's inventory of publications.
- **Notifications**: Notifies users about loan statuses, overdue books, and other important events.

## Technical Details:
- The system is developed using **object-oriented programming** (OOP) principles.
- It incorporates key OOP concepts such as **classes**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, **abstraction**, and **encapsulation**.
- The class hierarchy features at least **six attribute inheritances** and **four abstract classes** to ensure a flexible and efficient structure.

This system ensures efficient management of library operations and provides users with a seamless experience in interacting with the library's resources.
